# Lens

* New since version 7.9
* A simple way to create visualization to experiment with different types
* Drag and drop your data fields onto the visualization builder pane
* Lens automatically generates a visualization that best displays the selected data
* Supports visualizations with multiple layers and indices
* Allows to change visualization type without starting over with a new visualization
* A bit rough edges...
